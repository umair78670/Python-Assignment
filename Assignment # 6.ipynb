    "# Question No.1 Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question No.2 List down the benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- \n",
    "1) Modularity for easier troubleshooting.\n",
    "2) Reuse of code through inheritance.\n",
    "3) Flexibility through polymorphism.\n",
    "4) Effective problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question No.3 Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- \n",
    "-A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    "-A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    "    A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "    A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question No.4 Define the following terms:\n",
    "1. Class\n",
    "2. Object\n",
    "3. Attribute\n",
    "4. Behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Class: A category of objects. The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it.\n",
    "2) Object: A self-contained entity that consists of both data and procedures to manipulate the data.\n",
    "3) Attribute: Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance.\n",
    "4) Behaviour:  A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them. For example, to go back to the theoretical Motorcycle class, here are some behaviors that the Motorcycle class might have:\n",
